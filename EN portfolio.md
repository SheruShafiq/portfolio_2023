## **Introduction**

> ### [VR App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/VR%20App%20Repo.url)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

The project was introducted to us by our coach ([Bob van den Berge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-van-den-berge-3a57192b)). Together in collaboration with [Wintor](https://www.wintor.com/) we were able to create a VR app for our client, [Stichting Woon](https://www.wooninfo.nl/). The app was created in Untiy with in 10 sprints. It's available in 2 different languages and is[still used](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5Wo5FuJ6fikp_xKmyt3bI08N4RATX5E/view?usp=share_link) by the client to educate people on economincal awareness.</div>

> ### [Dashboard App](<./bewijsmateriaal/repos/DashBoardApp (In-House)/HLI-Dashboard-master>)

<div style="padding-left:20px;">

The dashboard app was my first project at Headline Interactive during my Internship. The idea was to build a [live dashboard](https://headline-interactive-dashboard-pv.netlify.app/) that displayed live analytics of all the comapany's project and turned the system off and on scheduled timings. The app was made in React(My first React app) with in 2 sprints and also recieved a [maintainence patch](https://github.com/SheruShafiq/HLI-Dashboard/commit/8a19c06f0fad8f747535d418f3b3e698335aa645).
There are two versions of this app, a custom built one with all the necassary keys and data pre loaded for In-House usage, and a public version that anyone can customize and use.

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

<div style="padding-left:20px;">

The project was more of a feature expansion, [suggested by myself](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/sollicitatieApp/headline_proposal.md) to my boss. As during my process of looking and applying for a placement, I felt a severe lack of information on the [company's job application section](https://headline-interactive.nl/vacature-backend-developer/). My boss loved the idea, and the project was concluded with in 3 sprints.</div>

## **Design**

> ### [VR App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/VR%20App%20Repo.url)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

After our [Kickoff meeting](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/VrApp/KickOffNotes.txt), the first step was to get a clear understanding of the client's wishes. So we saw fit to create a [UML Diagram](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/VRapp/1.3.pdf) that can help us visualize the structure of the application. So we may better plan our workflow and how we will aproach each story. [Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/) was used to create the diagram. Furthermore, since this was a collaberative project between the ROC and Bit Academy, the ROC student's [presentation](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/VRapp/KickOff.pptx) proved very useful to give us a basic understanding of the expected 3D envoirnment.

</div>

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

One of the the most important steps to this project was it's designing, as the one of the [core aspects](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/sollicitatieApp/Prototyping/features.md) was for it to match the [parent website's](https://headline-interactive.nl/) themes, styling, colors and animations perfectly. Making sure that the end user does not feel a difference between the [parent website](https://headline-interactive.nl/) and [the expansion](https://tourmaline-llama-c716a3.netlify.app/). Hence, together with our [lead Designer Erwin](./bewijsmateriaal/designs/SollicitatieApp/designReview%20proves/Erwin%20Chat.PNG), I spent most of the first sprint getting the design as accurate as possible on both [mobile](./bewijsmateriaal/designs/SollicitatieApp/HeadLine%20Stage%20Website%20Mobile%20Version.pdf) and [desktop](./bewijsmateriaal/designs/SollicitatieApp/HeadLine%20Stage%20Website%20Desktop%20Version.pdf).

</div>

> ### [VR App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/VR%20App%20Repo.url)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

Right after our [Kickoff meeting](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/DashboardApp/KickOffNotes.txt), the first step was to get a clear understanding of the client's wishes. So we saw fit to create a [UML Diagram](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/DashboardApp/1.3.pdf) that can help us visualize the structure of the application. So we may better plan our workflow and how we will aproach each story. [Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/) was used to create the diagram. Furthermore, since this was a collaberative project between the ROC and Bit Academy, the ROC student's [presentation](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/DashboardApp/KickOff.pptx) proved very useful to give us a basic understanding of the expected 3D envoirnment.

## **Planning**

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

As soon as my [proposal](<(./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/sollicitatieApp/headline_proposal.md)>) was submitted to the client, I, together with all [involved team members](#het-team), started planning and created a 3 sprint long, [day by day plan](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/sollicitatieApp/daily_plan.md) that covered everything from [kickoff](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/SolicitatieApp/KickoffMeeting/) to [demo](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/SolicitatieApp/demo/) and ensured all the standard scrum practices were executed. As this project was also an essential learning experience for me to broaden my know-how of working in a team.

</div>

> ### [VR App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

Right after our [briefing meeting](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/VrApp/dfg23.PNG), we began planning the strucutre and flow of the app. As it is a 3D experience, we must account for every possible action, view and behavior that we expect from the end user. To help visualize the structure of the app we created a [UML Diagram](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/VRapp/) in accordance with what we understood from the [kickoff meeting notes](./bewijsmateriaal/meetingProves/VrApp/KickOffNotes.txt) and the [presentation](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/VRapp/KickOff.pptx) given by the ROC students.

</div>

> ### [Personal Project](https://classy-beignet-940095.netlify.app/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

It isn't exactly anything significant at this moment, but I have been spending alot of time outside of work times learning ReactTHREE.fiber and WebGL as working with 3D in web really fascinates me and I have been pre-planning a personal project, at the moment, it's just a UML diagram and minor planning at the moment, but I do think it's worth a mention if we are mentioning in planning.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/SheruShafiq/Sheru-s-PV-Portfolio)

> ### [StopTober App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/Stoptober/stoptober/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

At my internship, I had a chance to help the Stoptober crew in the pre planning phase. I was mostly in charge of prototyping and market research, and it was truly a very informative experience. In the pre planning phase I had the chance to [research]('./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/stoptober/Book1.xlsx') the smoking apps market very extensively on both Android and IOS platforms and [present](./bewijsmateriaal/pre-planning/stoptober/presentatie.docx) it to folks from VPRO. I also got the chance to broaden my knowledge about [flutter](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/Stoptober/stoptober/) while prototyping for the app. Due to confidential reasons however, I am legally not allowed to share things like testing envoirnments, documentation, tests and internal desings etc. So unfortunately, I cant provide proves for most things.

## **Realisation**

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

I pride myself with how heavily I documented this project, a day by day log, work flow plan, board exports, commit history and test plans can be found below. These documents are detailed enough to easily portray each and every step that was taken to realise the app from design to code.

## **Testen**

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">
The app was tested throughly in Cypress testing framework. Each user story was given it's own testplan and scopes to ensure that the application functioned optimally under all circumstances.
Testing documentation can be found below.

## </div>

## **Refactor**

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

One of the rather large [component](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/src/components/FormComponent.jsx) was outlined by one of my colleagues, hence I very [recently](https://github.com/SheruShafiq/Job-Application/pull/2) have re factored the component and better documented it to ensure better readbility and reusablity. You can see the changes and review by my senior in the pull request below.

## **Retrospective**

> ### [VR App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

We have conducted RetroSpectives during our project to ensure that any issues we have had during the sprint do not repeat. It also helped us alot in developing better communication between the team and adress all and every pain-points in a comfortable and proper manner. RetroSpective notes can be found below.

## **Demo**

> ### [Job Application App](./bewijsmateriaal/repos/SollicitatieApp/)

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

Thanks to a robus planning and impecabble respect for scheduel from the entire team, we managed to complete the project in expected time and I got the chance this feature expansion. One of my colleagues was nice enough to record it for me(Recording Link below). More details on the demo, like the presentation and notes can also be found below.

 <div style="padding-left:20px;">

This project is quite near and dear to my heart, as it was recieved quite well by the client, coaches and the end users as well. This project allowed me to meet amazing people from alot of different professions that I otherwise would've never had the chance to. Unfortunately due to technical difficulties with our version control system and educational platform Jarvis we have lost alot of our data regarding this project.But some of the the recordings and images from our demos can be found below.
