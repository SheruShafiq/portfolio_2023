Headline Interactive is a company that primarily builds all of it's apps in Wordpress, hence I have also had the chance to learn to work in Wordpress. In my time there, one of my projects was to create a website for a reporter "Mats Heffels".

The project can't encorprated into the exam as its a codeless apps, but I still think it deserves a mention as it was built entirely by me.

Website was built using Elementor, Wordpress and GMAIL API.
